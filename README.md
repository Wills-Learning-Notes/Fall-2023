# Will's Learning Notes - Fall 2023

This repository mainly serves as a tool to track both my coursework and independent learning. Its main objectives are to help me maintain alignment with my plan (i.e., not procrastinate), foster a consistent note-taking habit, and offer help during reviews.

These notes may have omissions in the conceptual derivations, skip over related or prerequisite concepts, or even inadvertently present inaccurate information. If you find any inaccuracies, please email me at wicai@berkeley.edu.

Given that I began documenting these notes towards the end of September, the notes from the first month will be concise.

I appreciate your company on this learning journey.
